#The Three Buttoneers

The process from start to finish consisted of many steps, some in which we struggled with a little bit.

First we agreed on our online business model, which provides the service of producing stylized digital buttons including the text of the users choice.

Next, using the UML modeling tool we created a flow chart of each component.  Our design moves in several steps, starting with a text field the user inputs text of their choice, followed by choosing 1 of 5 custom(arbitrary) styles, and then colors last. You can see the [UML model here.](https://github.com/ffmegaman/buttonDesigner/blob/master/buttonDesigner/web_buttons.jpg)

The output auto-updates the button as they move through each step and can change automatically without needing to start over or refresh.  Additionally, we included the HTML and the CSS of the buttons so that they can copy-and-paste for their own personal use.

The site has a splash page, an About page, and the button generator page, where all the magic happens.  This is the heart of our work and it involved a lot of JavaScript and corresponding HTML/CSS code, courtesy of Philip and Kevin.  Outside of the generator code, Emmanuel put forth great effort in creating a highly stylized website, with elaborate visuals and interactive buttons/links for the user’s convenience.

We encountered many conflicts merging our work laterally and believe we spent a lot of time transitioning these merges to keep the project equal for all contributors.  But it is understood that this is part of the learning process and we’ll get better at it the more we practice.
